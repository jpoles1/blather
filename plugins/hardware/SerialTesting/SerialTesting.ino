/*
  Serial Event example
 
 When new serial data arrives, this sketch adds it to a String.
 When a newline is received, the loop prints the string and 
 clears it.
 
 A good test for this is to try it with a GPS receiver 
 that sends out NMEA 0183 sentences.

/*
  SerialEvent occurs whenever a new data comes in the
 hardware serial RX.  This routine is run between each
 time loop() runs, so using delay inside loop can delay
 response.  Multiple bytes of data may be available.
